## Calculating travel radius### SummaryThis code contains a function for the creation and downloading of a file showing the radius one can travel from a point in a specified time.### DataData must be provided by the individual, and needs to have the following columns:* 'Location_Name': The name of the location, to be used for the file name* 'Postcode': The postcode of the location* 'Rural_Urban': Whether the location is predominantly urban or rural### Key Function Features* Measurements are in miles (this can be changed in the function below)* A medium accuracy radius is calculated - more code would need to be added into the function to change this to low or high accuracy* The method of transport is driving - more code would need to be added into the function to change this* For areas assumed to be close to faster, rural roads, a speed of 49mph is assumed - this is the average speed on national speed limit roads, as detailed in [these Department for Transport (DfT) statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/623261/vehicle-speed-compliance-statistics-2016.pdf)* For areas assumed to be in more urban areas, a speed of 37mph is assumed. This is based in an average speed on urban roads of 25mph (also from the above statistics) and an average speed of 49mph on national speed limit roads, with exactly half the time spent at each speed. This assumption was built from a travel time of one hour, but might have to be adjusted if the travel time is changed* The function will wait for 120 seconds for the radius to be calculated before timing out, this may need to be increased or decreased, particularly if the accuracy of the radius is altered
